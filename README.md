# census-pandas
For now, idle exploration around making it easier to use the pandas library to analyze Census data.
 
## Background
A while ago, [Hunter Owens asked](https://twitter.com/hunter_owens/status/565209535552692224) 
if we knew about anyone using the [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) data analysis package
with the Census Reporter API. I whipped up some [example code in a gist](https://gist.github.com/JoeGermuska/1ed425c068d540326854)
and went on with things.

Recently I started fooling around with it a little more and decided to put it on Github in case anyone else was interested. 
For a brief moment I considered trying to port [Ezra Glenn's acs.R package](http://dusp.mit.edu/uis/publication/acsr-r-package-neighborhood-level-data-us-census), 
but I quickly realized that that is an enormous accomplishment and honestly, I don't do enough data analysis on a routine basis to be motivated.

## Contributing
I'm open to input and pull requests. Who knows where this will go.
